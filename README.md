# About 

This repository contains the code for http://pakistanjs.com/ which is a community website to help people become software engineers. The content is in Urdu and can easily be understood by anyone who understands Urdu or Hindi. 

The current live version is based on the index.html, ./main.js and main.css, hosted on github pages which is soon going to be retired as the same application has been built with react and going to be moved to a dedicated host.
